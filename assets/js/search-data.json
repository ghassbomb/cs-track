I will learn through books for the most part, because I am most comfortable with them. When I work through books, I study through them maybe one or two hours a day, or till I complete a certain part/subchapter, and the exercises as well. I will take notes and solve exercises using LaTeX. For more complex problems, I will likely attempt them using paper and pencil before transcribing. I might turn this into a webpage someday. ",
