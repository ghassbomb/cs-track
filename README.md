# Computer Science Track

## The Brief

This repository exists for three main reasons:

- To function as a sort of track for my progress in learning the elements of Computer Science
- To contain my notes and exercises as I work through various books on the subject
- For the reference of other people who may want to teach themselves Computer Science

I will learn through *books* for the most part, because I am most comfortable with them. When I work through books, I study through them maybe one or two hours a day, or till I complete a certain part/subchapter, and the exercises as well. 

I will take notes and solve exercises using LaTeX. For more complex problems, I will likely attempt them using paper and pencil before transcribing.

I might turn this into a webpage someday.

## The Plan

My syllabus is taken from the [TeachYourselfCS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) website. In tandem to this course, I plan to practice web development.
