# Computer Science Track

*This README won't be updated, check out the site --> [ghassbomb.github.io/cs-track](https://ghassbomb.github.io/cs-track)*

## The Plan

See [sources](#sources) for the various sources I adapted this syllabus from.

- Programming
  - [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](./prog/sicp/index)
- Computer Architecture
  - Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
- Algorithms and Data Structures
  - The Algorithm Design Manual
- Operating Systems
  - Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
- Computer Networking
  - Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach
- Databases
  - Readings in Database Systems
- Languages & Compilers
  - Crafting Interpreters
- Distributed Systems
  - Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## The Brief

This repository exists for three main reasons:

- To function as a sort of track for my progress in learning the elements of Computer Science
- To contain my notes and exercises as I work through various books on the subject
- For the reference of other people who may want to teach themselves Computer Science

I will learn through *books* for the most part, because I am most comfortable with them. When I work through books, I study through them maybe one or two hours a day, or till I complete a certain part/subchapter, and the exercises as well.

I will take notes and solve exercises using LaTeX. For more complex problems, I will likely attempt them using paper and pencil before transcribing.
